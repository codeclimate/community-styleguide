# Style Guides

A consistent style is important in a code base. Inconsistency greatly increases the number of inconsequential decisions developers must make. Consistency is good for readability and a clean code base promotes keeping a code base clean (i.e. Broken Window Theory). 

This repository contains a collection of popular style guides that can be used to help enforce good coding standards within your team. Feel free to use these guides in some of your own projects and 

## Guides

This repository currently includes written guides & relevant linter configuration for the following languages:

* JavaScript
* Ruby

## Configuration

Developers who work with multiple repositories may want to use external configurations for engines to ensure consistent engine results between those repositories. Code Climate makes it easy to keep these shared configuration files in a single location and have them fetched on-demand when analysis is performed. Please see our instructions on how to set this up here: (hps://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-the-prepare-step)
